What is Non Clustered indexing in database?


A Non Clustered Index in SQL Server stores the index structure separately from the data that is physically stored in a table. 
SQL Server allows you to create almost 999 non clustered indexes per table.

The non clustered index in Sql Server is very useful to improve the query performance. 

For example, if you had Customer table. Assume Customer key is Primary key (means Clustered Index) but your requirement is to retrieve records by yearly Income.

In this situation we have to create a non clustered index on Yearly Income column. 
This will store the Yearly income records in separate location along with the row address. 
When you ask for customer record whose Income  = 79000. 
First, SQL will look for 79000 in second table and after finding the record it will check the row address. 
Second, it will retrieve record (from First table) at that row address.

SYNTAX:

CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [INDEX_NAME]
ON [TABLE_NAME] ([COLUMN_NAME] ASC)
